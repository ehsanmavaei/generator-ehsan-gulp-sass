# Gulp + Sass boilerplate

A Yeoman generator that creates a minimal Gulp and Sass front-end workflow.


## Instructions

Install Yeoman globally: `npm install -g yo`

Then install the Gulp + Sass boilerplate generator globally: `npm install -g generator-ehsan-gulp-sass`

Navigate to a directory you want to generate the files in, then run `yo ehsan-gulp-sass`

To run, you will need to have the Gulp CLI also installed globally:
